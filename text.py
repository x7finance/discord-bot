        '• At its core, leveraged ILOs means anyone with a good idea can raise 10-1000X the amount of Eth in ' \

    "Problem Summary\n\nFrom the beginning of human civilization, lenders have sought ways to mitigate the risk of "
    "losing their loaned principal. Several mechanisms have helped to reduce risk, the most common among them are "
    "“over-collateralization”, the process of having the underlying asset be more valuable than the loan amount (for "
    "example a house should be worth more than the mortgage), “know-your-customer”, the process of collecting personal"
    " data, income, credit scores and other information to compute the ability and likelihood of loan repayment and "
    "“default recovery”, the process of recovering the loan value through force or default (banks use the legal system"
    " and repossession agents).\n\nCryptocurrency’s immutability and security models make all of the traditional risks "

    "Technical Abstract\n\nXchange is built on a forked version of the Uniswap V2 Factory, Liquidity Pair, and Router "
    "contracts. There are two notable changes:\n● The Liquidity Pair contract has added safeguards to allow it to "
    "support leveraged liquidity additions that ensure the leverage remains collateralized and can be liquidated in the"
    " event of loan default and appropriately manage Liquidity Tokens during an active Initial Liquidity Loan.\n● The "
    "liquidity provider fee has been reduced from 0.3% to 0.2%. This reflects the reality that in many cases the "
    "liquidity providers for tokens are actually the token creators and the benefit they receive is more often via "
    "token price appreciation or token fees, not liquidity provision. Additionally, the User Interface will allow a "
    "seamless experience trading across other Uniswap V2 style decentralized exchange pairs (such as Uniswap or "
    "SushiSwap).",
    "Swap\n\nSimilar to Uniswap, token swaps in Xchange are a simple way to trade one ERC-20 token for another.\n\nFor "
    "end-users, swapping is intuitive: a user picks an input token and an output token. They specify an input amount, "
    "and the protocol calculates how much of the output token they’ll receive. They then execute the swap with one "
    "click, receiving the output token in their wallet immediately.\n\nSwaps in Xchange are different from trades on "
    "traditional centralized exchange platforms. Xchange does not use an order book to represent liquidity or determine"
    " prices. Xchange uses a constant product automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on rates and"
    " slippage.",
    "Pricing\n\nSimilar to Uniswap, Xchange uses the constant product formula.",
    "Lending Pool Overview\n\nTo provide leverage to the system, the Lending Pool acts as the manager of both funds and"
    " loans. This contract will be interacted with by Xchange.",
    "Liquidity, Loans, Lending Pool Overview\n\nIn order for a Swap to occur, there must be liquidity in the system. "
    "Liquidity can be summarized as capital, ETH, provided to create a token’s price. X7 Finance is designed to provide"
    " initial liquidity to the pair in the form of loans. Those loans are originated from the Lending Pool and pairs "
    "are hosted on Xchange.",
    "Lending Pool Funding\n\nThe Lending Pool is funded through two primary mechanism, by external deposits made by "
    "any wallet and through money owned by the system.",
    "System Owed Money\n\nTo fund the Lending Pool, ETH from the X7 token ecosystem has been accumulating in the "
    "Ecosystem Splitter and will be the first liquidity deposited into the Lending Pool. This ETH will be locked "
    "forever and will grow over time. Users are also able to contribute to the Lending Pool via Deposits. The code owns"
    " this money and it will never leave the system.",
    "External Deposits\n\nUsers will be able to deposit ETH and receive an X7 deposit token. When X7Deposit is minted,"
    " it is a face value equivalent to ETH.\n\n1 X7D = 1 ETH\n\nWhen deposited, the ETH will enter the Lending Pool and"
    " be available for automated lending. The Lending Pool will maintain a reserve of constellation tokens sufficient "
    "to back any externally funded Lending Pool liquidity. X7D tokens can be wrapped in an NFT and staked. At maturity,"
    " this NFT will pay returns based on the rising constellation token floor.",
    "Lending Functionality\n\nLending is a fully automatic process managed fully by Xchange’s interfacing with the "
    "Lending Pool via Initial Liquidity Loans.\n\nFor end-users, wanting to participate in lending: a user selects the "
    "amount of Ether to deposit or withdraw from the Lending Pool. Receipts for deposit are issued in X7 deposit, "
    "redeemable 1-to-1 with Eth, and may be staked for a portion of the loan fees.",
    "Initial Liquidity Loan\n\nAn initial liquidity loan provides a mechanism to add initial liquidity to an automated "
    "market making trading pair with borrowed capital. The terms and conditions for borrowing this capital and "
    "returning it to the lender provide for the lender and the borrower to manage their cost of capital and repayment "
    "schedules in a way that supports the nature of the offering and the size and duration of the loan.",
    "Initial Liquidity Loan Terms\n\nLoan terms are defined by standalone smart contracts that provide the following:"
    "\n\n1. Loan origination fee\n2. Loan retention premium fee schedule\n3. Principal repayment condition/maximum loan"
    " duration\n4. Liquidation conditions and Reward\n5. Loan duration",
    "Loan Liquidation\n\nAnyone may liquidate eligible loans through a transaction. Doing so will result in the "
    "borrowed capital being returned to the lender (Lending Pool or third-party lender) and the liquidator will receive"
    " the liquidation bounty.",
    "Initial Liquidity Loan Origination\n\nInitial Liquidity Loans can be funded in two ways, Lending Pool originated "
    "loans and Tokenized loans that may be fulfilled by any wallet.",
    "Lending Pool Origination\n\nIf the Lending Pool has sufficient liquidity to fund a loan, the loan will immediately"
    " be funded and the AMM liquidity pair will be created. Loan origination fees will be collected and proceeds will "
    "be distributed throughout the X7 ecosystem. A portion of the origination fee will feed back into the Lending Pool"
    " to grow the capital available for automatic lending.",
    "Tokenized Loans\n\nWhen a leveraged pair loan is requested that cannot be serviced due to insufficient liquidity "
    "within the Lending Pool, the request will cause an NFT to be minted. This NFT can be claimed by funding the loan, "
    "and results in an instantaneous return to the claimer of part of the loan origination fee. Possession of the NFT "
    "grants the holder a portion of the premium returns in the future as well as rights to claim the initial lent "
    "principal.\n\nThis mechanism will allow for a more effective bootstrapping period during which the Lending Pool "
    "may not have the proper liquidity to meet loan demand.\n\nIt will also provide a means for the lending platform "
    "to meet truly extraordinary lending requirements where third party liquidity providers can provide massive initial"
    " liquidity for an immediate return.\n\nSince these loans will be represented by ownership of an NFT and the "
    "benefits accrue to the owner of the NFT, the NFT itself may be transferred, auctioned, bought, sold, or held by "
    "smart contract to create a variety of ways that a lender may attempt to maximize their profit, limit their short "
    "term exposure, or otherwise draw upon their lent capital before the loan term concludes.\n\nDeFi participants are "
    "encouraged to create private “Lending Pools” that will attempt to fund loans (a risk less activity) and pay "
    "returns to liquidity providers. The X7 ecosystem will not provide this particular capability.",
    "Lending Terms Governance\n\nThe lending process delegates the loan terms to standalone smart contracts (see "
    "whitepaper for more details). These loan terms contracts must be deployed, and then “added” or “removed” from the "
    "Lending Pool as “available” loan terms for new loans. The DAO will be able to add or remove these term contracts."
    "\n\nLoan term contracts may be created by any interested third party, enabling a market process by which new loan"
    " terms may be invented, provided they implement the proper interface.",
    "Borrowing\n\nMuch in the same way an IPO is underwritten by a bank as a market maker, the X7 borrowing capability"
    " provides this capacity within the context of the Uniswap V2 automated market maker technology.\n\nThe core "
    "borrowing functionality within X7 applies to Initial Liquidity Offerings.\n\nThis capability allows for new "
    "liquidity pairs to be created with borrowed ETH. This lowers cost to launch a project, increase liquidity, and "
    "reduces the amount of capital locked to a pair.\n\nXchange’s intuitive UI will allow an easy selection of terms."
    " Simply select the amount you wish to borrow and the Initial Liquidity Loan term you want to use, and the number "
    "of tokens you wish to include in the pair.",
    "Borrower’s Liquidity Tokens\n\nLiquidity Tokens are sent to the borrower’s specified address and remain in full "
    "control by the borrower. The borrower is free to lock the liquidity in any service they wish, transfer or hold "
    "them. Liquidity Tokens are not able to be redeemed for the liquidity while a loan is active.",
    "Default\n\nIn the case of a default through any of the terms violated specified on the Initial Liquidity Loan, the"
    " Loan becomes eligible for liquidation."
    "All dynamic aspects of the X7 ecosystem will ultimately rest with the DAO to decide upon.\n\nThe DAO will be "
    "responsible for modifying tokenomics, changing profit allocation, upgrading the upgradeable components, and "

    "portion of project revenue will flow into the DAO token in the form of liquidity injections.\n\n The expected "
    "outcome is that DAO holders will maximize the medium and long-term gain of the DAO token. The ecosystem properly "
    "aligns this selfish profit motive with the efficient and healthy operation of the ecosystem.",

    "\n\nThe DAO will be responsible for modifying tokenomics, changing profit allocation, upgrading the upgradeable "

    "the DAO, and a portion of project revenue will flow into the DAO token in the form of liquidity injections.\n\n"
    "The expected outcome is that DAO holders will maximize the medium and long-term gain of the DAO token. The "
    "ecosystem properly aligns this selfish profit motive with the efficient and healthy operation of the ecosystem.",
    "Governance Control Structure\n\nThe DAO shall operate through central governance contracts. For all functions the "
    "DAO may control, there will be two options:\n\n1. Make the relevant change\n2. Delegate the authority to make "
    "those kinds of changes to an address.",
    "DAO configuration\n\nThe core quorum and proposal thresholds are not configurable.\n\nHowever, it is not known "
    "a-priori how rapid voting phases should be. There is a tradeoff between speed of execution and time for "
    "deliberation that must be balanced. The initial durations for each proposal phase will be set as a starting point."
    " However, these durations may be changed (within hard-coded limits) to meet future governance needs.",
    "*Proposals and Voting*\n\nVoting will occur in multiple phases, each of which has either a minimum or maximum "
    "time phase duration.\n\n*Phase 1: Quorum-seeking*\nX7DAO token holders will be able to stake their tokens as "
    "X7sDAO, a non-transferable staked version of X7DAO.\n\nA quorum is reached when more than 50% of circulating "
    "X7DAO has been staked as X7sDAO.\n\nOnce a quorum is reached and a minimum quorum-seeking time period has "
    "passed, the X7sDAO tokens are temporarily locked (and no more X7DAO tokens may be staked until the next Quorum "
    "seeking period) and the governance process moves to the next phase\n\n*Phase 2: Proposal creation*\nA proposal "
    "is created by running a transaction on the governance contract which specifies a specific transaction on a "
    "specific contract (e.g. setFeeNumerator(0) on the X7R token contract).\n\nProposals are ordered, and any "
    "proposals that are passed/adopted must be run in the order that they were created.\n\nProposals can be made "
    "by X7sDAO stakes of 500,000 tokens or more. Additionally, holders of Magister tokens may make proposals. "
    "Proposals may require a refundable proposal fee to prevent process griefing.\n\n*Phase 3: Proposal voting*\n"
    "Each proposal may be voted on once by each address. The voter may specify the weight of their vote between 0 "
    "and the total amount of X7sDAO they have staked.\n\nProposals pass by a majority vote of the quorum of X7sDAO "
    "tokens.\n\nA parallel voting process will occur with Magister tokens, where each Magister token carries one "
    "vote.\n\nIf a majority of magister token holders vote against a proposal, the proposal must reach an X7sDAO vote "
    "of 75% of the quorum of X7sDAO tokens.\n\n*Phase 4: Proposal adoption*\nDuring this phase, proposals that have "
    "passed will be enqueued for execution. This step ensures proper ordering and is a guard against various forms of "
    "process griefing.\n\n*Phase 5: Proposal execution*\nAfter proposal adoption, all passed proposals must be executed"
    " before a new Quorum Seeking phase may commence.",
    "Process Adaptation\n\nSince any change that the core DAO governance process can control may be delegated, novel "
    "other mechanisms for voting may be created and changes can be delegated to that new process.\n\nFor example, a "
    "trusted group of individuals could be delegated control, and that trusted group could run an off-chain trustful "
    "process of voting.\n\nIf this process was ever corrupted, the DAO could regain trust-less on-chain control through"
    " a majority vote.\n\nThe X7 developers believe this governance structure will enable novel future governance "
    "innovation while never permanently relinquishing control to any external authority.",
    "Tokenized Governance\n\nThe X7 DAO structure is highly codified and provides almost no direct latitude for human "
    "intervention. This is by design and is one of the greatest strengths of the X7 DAO governance structure.\n\nThere"
    " is however a chance that through collusion and the inaction of DAO holders a large DAO holder could submit a "
    "proposal that was in their best interest and and not the best interest of the project.\n\n To help provide a check"
    " and balance, a maximum of 49 Magister tokens can be minted. Seven of these tokens were minted and given to the "
    "X7 development team. The other 42 may be minted for a fee.\n\n Any proposal may be vetoed by a majority of minted "
    "Magister tokens. It will require a ¾ super majority DAO vote to overturn a Magister veto.\n\n An additional side "
    "effect of this governance feature is that the original ecosystem developers will retain a level of authority at "
    "the beginning of DAO control handover, but this authority can and will be diluted as Magister tokens are minted. "
    "The final governance influence of the original developers will become minimal once all Magister tokens have been"
    " minted, and once 8 additional Magister tokens are minted the original developers will no longer maintain a "
    "controlling voting block on Magister votes.",
    "X7 ecosystem token Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP)\n\nThe original stealth launched tokens had their liquidity "
    "tokens sent to the burn wallet. This was to instill confidence in investors of a stealth launch that there was no"
    " intention or ability to withdraw the capital in the liquidity pairs.\n\nWhile the X7 ecosystem of smart contracts"
    " is being built with the flexibility and resilience to last, it is possible that eventually a systemic upgrade "
    "will need to take place. All X7 ecosystem tokens LP tokens (initial + auto liquidity) are being locked in a "
    "time-lock contract. The default destination for this LP will be the burn wallet and the starting lock time will "
    "be 2 years. The DAO will be able to perform any of the following actions on the time lock contract:\n\n1. Extend "
    "the time lock\n2. Change the receiver\n\nWhen the time lock expires, the receiver address will be able to "
    "withdraw any of the tokens in any amount. This will allow trust-less, contract driven migrations from the old "
    "tokens to new uses for that LP. If no action is taken the LP will remain locked as no transactions will ever be "
    "received from the dead address.",
    "Tokenomics\n\nA typical structure for funding project operations from tokens is to collect a percentage of traded"
    " tokens and periodically swap those tokens in the ETH pair.\n\nThe variables associated with this activity are:\n"
    "1. Percent of swap transaction tokens collected on buys and sells\n2. The token balance threshold at which to swap"
    " tokens into ETH\n3. The maximum swap transaction size (to limit extreme downward price action and maximize token"
    " return).\n4. Allocation of swapped ETH:\na. Collected for operations\nb. Buy back and burn\nc. Buy back and add "
    "liquidity\n\nAll of these settings will be dynamic and modifiable to affect the allocations of capital throughout "
    "the ecosystem.",
    "Advanced Trading and Revenues\n\nThere will be a complex interplay between the transfer of funds between:\n\n● The"
    " Lending Pool\n● The staked (pegged) ETH token\n● The “constellation” token liquidity sink\n● The reward token\n"
    "● The dao token\n\nAt various moments money will flow between the Lending Pool, the constellation tokens, and the"
    " staked ETH token, and opportunistic traders may find swing trading or arbitrage trading profitable. This swing "
    "trading will drive tokens and fees back into the rest of the ecosystem and provide a solid financial vehicle for "
    "speculation on future growth.\n\nThis kind of trading is intended for advanced traders. The full breadth of "
    "strategies this ecosystem will support are not known apriori and will be discovered.",
    "X7R\n\nIn order to attract as many interested parties into the ecosystem and ensure that the number of people "
    "that can benefit from this decentralized system is maximized, a deflationary “benefit” or “reward” token will "
    "exist that will receive buybacks, burns, and liquidity additions.\n\nThis token will be most interesting to retail"
    " investors that want to be exposed to the overall upside without significant effort on their part.\n\n At the "
    "start, this token will have a token fee associated with trading it, but it is expected that the DAO will lower "
    "that fee to zero once there is less need for ad-hoc manual capital injection.\n\nThis token is expected to "
    "eventually be traded on every major centralized exchange.",
    "X7DAO\n\nAn ERC20 governance token which allows holders to vote on fee rates, loan terms, funding terms, "
    "tradable token tax terms, distribution of capital flows and any additional settings on and off chain. This "
    "includes the establishment of committees and other foundational efforts off chain.\n\nThere is a complex interplay"
    " between the various tokens and contracts within the X7 ecosystem. While the X7 development team will seed these "
    "contracts with reasonable percentages, rates, terms, etc. the optimal values are not known apriori.\n\nHolders of"
    " X7DAO tokens will be able to participate in proposals to modify various settings across the ecosystem.\n\nA "
    "portion of lending and DEX revenue will flow into the X7DAO liquidity pair as buybacks and liquidity additions as"
    " well as direct rewards to X7DAO voters.",
    "X7Deposit (X7D)\n\nA wrapped ETH token will exist to encourage capital injection into the Lending Pool. Users will"
    " mint these X7Deposit tokens at a 1:1 face value of ETH.\n\nIn the beginning of the X7 ecosystem, this will be "
    "similar to holding ETH, and there will be zero risk to adding ETH to the Lending Pool.\n\nX7Deposit tokens may be"
    " staked for rewards in the form of a perpetual annuity that performs against the growth of liquidity within "
    "the system.",
    "Tokenized X7D Deposits\n\nWhen X7Deposit is staked an NFT is generated which records the following:\n\n1. Amount "

    "lockup period\n\nAfter the maturity date, the holder of the NFT will be able to withdraw profit and re-stake or "
    "withdraw their X7Deposit.\n\nProfits are determined by comparing the locked liquidity floor price of the "
    "constellation tokens at staking time to the current locked liquidity floor price. A large portion of the "
    "lending proceeds will go towards buying back and adding locked liquidity to the constellation tokens. This "
    "activity provides a mechanism for calculating an actual return that reflects the profit from lending.\n\nStaked "
    "X7D NFTs will have an intrinsic value above the X7D/ETH redemption face value and may be traded on NFT markets as"
    " a form of a future on the Lending Pool returns.",
    "Non-Fungible Tokens\n\nOver the last few years there have been plenty of examples of NFTs selling jpegs. But NFTs "
    "within the X7 ecosystem will be pure utility.\n\nThe mint price and NFT capabilities may be controlled by the DAO"

    "Tokenized Discounts and Benefits\n\nWithin the X7 ecosystem, various parts of the system incur fees. LP trading "
    "fees on the decentralized exchange, loan origination fees, loan interest, and token swap fees. Providing a limited"
    " set of NFTs that provide discounts and other benefits will enable power users and community members to "
    "significantly reduce their cost of use and encourage adoption.",
    "Future Developments\n\nThe X7 ecosystem provides mechanisms not only for individual investors and lenders to "
    "profit from the ecosystem activities but also for the flow of capital into the hands of the DAO (and its "
    "delegates).\n\nOur expectation is that these funds will at first be focused on marketing and business development "
    "activities, but then in the future will fund other kinds of project needs, such as additional features and "
    "components to the blockchain ecosystem and the user interface.\n\nWe would find it plausible that the DAO could "
