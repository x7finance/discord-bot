"In a DeFi world filled with meme tokens, larps, and “speculative” projects, X7 was stealth launched to bootstrap a community and be a test bed for the technology and ideas that the teams have been thinking about and working on in the background",
"In recent years, exchanges across the globe have been shutting their doors to customers simply because a sovereign state has decreed it. X7 is designed to overcome those shortcomings and give power back to the people",
"Permissionless - No individual, organization, or sovereign state actor shall infringe on the functionality and usability of X7’s system. We believe the world is better with free speech and freedom and our system is designed to prevent asking permission to interact with the system.",
"Trustless - Exemplified by the “Problem Statement” section, traditional loan systems have a problem with trust. Principle among them, is the trust that your loan will be repaid. X7’s DEX is able to allow trustless loans between the Lending Pool and the Initial Liquidity Loan Requestor, leading to higher market capitalization and access to capital.",
"Censorship Resistant - Multinational corporations exert massive control over the finances of everyday people and recent stories of Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal blacklisting ordinary citizens from transacting on their networks highlight the need for a system to be resilient and resistant to those forms of censorship.",
"Decentralized Architecture - Engineering a system to not have single points of failure is a difficult task. X7 will run all parts of the system in multiple locations and open-source the final product so anyone can run the source code anywhere.",
"Decentralized Governance - Designing management processes to be handled by a group is also a difficult task, but X7’s governance strategy is optimized to aggregate large groups’ opinions into smaller decisions to vote on.",

"Trade like a whale\n\nAll of the trading functionality and utility you have come to expect in a DEX and more. Swapping is simple, mobile optimized and offers lower fees than the other exchanges. A truly decentralized and censorship-resistant exchange.",
"Democratic Decentralized Governance\n\nAfter launch and discovery of market equilibrium terms, all controls will be transferred to a Voting Contract. This contract has control over setting fee rates, loan terms, funding terms, tax terms, distribution of capital flows and any additional settings. Who can make and vote on proposals? Holders of X7DAO tokens and Magister NFTs.",
"X7 Token Ecosystem\n\nX7 is designed to address the needs of four major quadrants within decentralized finance. The symbiotic nature of each segment in the X7 Finance ecosystem provides fluid insurance for lenders and mutual funding for all other market participants.",
"X7100 Constellation\n\nA novel - eventually price consistent collection of five tokens. These act as the backstop to the Lending Pool. The X7100 series of tokens are burned on every transaction. While continually raising its floor price - it also provides further opportunities to mint new X7Deposit tokens.",

The X7 Finance protocol will only permit minting of new X7 Deposit tokens when on-chain reserves permit.",
"X7R\n\nX7's original launched token. Hodl as a percentage of all transaction fees are used to buy and burn tokens, reducing total supply of available tokens.",
"Community\n\nAll official channels are run by community members in a decentralized fashion. We believe a distributed network of individuals and committees - free from central influence is paramount to the longevity of decentralized finance.",
"At the heart of X7 is a peer-to-peer Automated Market Making (AMM) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) integrated with a novel trustless, permissionless on-chain undercollateralized loan origination and servicing system known as the Lending Pool. Functioning similar to a bank, the Lending Pool takes deposits, converts them to loanable assets, manages the lifecycle of a loan issued to X7’s DEX, and distributes the loan profits to the ecosystem.",
"Tokenholder Value\n\n Generating Tokenholder Value is fundamental for long term success of X7 Finance and our tokenomics have been architected with that in mind.\n\nOwn a piece of the profits generated by the X7 Finance project by holding any of the tokens:\n\nX7DAO, engineered to lead the ecosystem through it’s governance utility.\n\nX7R, designed to reward long-term holders through deflationary mechanisms.\n\nThe Constellation tokens, X7101, X7102, X7103, X7104, X7105, are eventually price consistent allowing for arbitrage opportunities.",
"Problem Summary\n\nFrom the beginning of human civilization, lenders have sought ways to mitigate the risk of losing their loaned principal. Several mechanisms have helped to reduce risk, the most common among them are “over-collateralization”, the process of having the underlying asset be more valuable than the loan amount (for example a house should be worth more than the mortgage), “know-your-customer”, the process of collecting personal data, income, credit scores and other information to compute the ability and likelihood of loan repayment and “default recovery”, the process of recovering the loan value through force or default (banks use the legal system and repossession agents).\n\nCryptocurrency’s immutability and security models make all of the traditional risks even greater. X7 solves all of these difficult problems by implementing a stop to liquidity events through the Xchange and Lending Pool architecture. This paper will explain the product functionality and architecture that enables X7 to operate.",
"Multi-chain Rollout\n\nThe initial release of X7 Finance’s innovative token ecosystem and Xchange will be focused on the Ethereum blockchain. Our architecture and contracts will be able to run on all Ethereum Virtual Machine-compliant blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Polygon, but to deliver a refined and polished experience we are taking a sequential blockchain release approach.",
"Xchange\n\n● Permissionless, trustless peer-to-peer AMM platform for swapping of ERC-20 tokens, seamless integration with Ethereum for swapping of ERC20-to-ERC20 and ETH-to-ERC20.\n● Add Initial Liquidity to any ETH-based pair with our permissionless, trustless Initial Liquidity Loan (ILL) functionality, increasing liquidity and market capitalization.\n● First among peers, X7’s DEX’s front-end dApp will connect and function with all top Uniswap Interface-compliant DEX’s.",
"Initial Liquidity Loan\n\n● Defined loan term created in a permissionless, trustless fashion to be funded and originated by the Lending Pool.",
"Lending Pool\n\n● Manage loan terms availability, respond to loan origination requests, and balance reserves ratios.\n● Manages deposits through a permissionless, trustless fully collateralized mintable deposit token, with a 1-to-1 face value of ETH, that can be staked for a share of the profits.",
"Constellation Token\n\n● Collateralized reserves for Lending Pool’s X7 Deposit tokens, with the functionality to accumulate token value and act as lender of last resort against X7Deposit token issuance.",
"Decentralized Anonymous Organization\n\n● Manage operations of a system with a democratic decentralized governance model among self-interested on-chain actors.\n● Balance of power provided by a team mint and future high-cost mint NFTs to balance power and interests in the system.",
"Technical Abstract\n\nXchange is built on a forked version of the Uniswap V2 Factory, Liquidity Pair, and Router contracts. There are two notable changes:\n● The Liquidity Pair contract has added safeguards to allow it to support leveraged liquidity additions that ensure the leverage remains collateralized and can be liquidated in the event of loan default and appropriately manage Liquidity Tokens during an active Initial Liquidity Loan.\n● The liquidity provider fee has been reduced from 0.3% to 0.2%. This reflects the reality that in many cases the liquidity providers for tokens are actually the token creators and the benefit they receive is more often via token price appreciation or token fees, not liquidity provision. Additionally, the User Interface will allow a seamless experience trading across other Uniswap V2 style decentralized exchange pairs (such as Uniswap or SushiSwap).",
"Similar to Uniswap, token swaps in Xchange are a simple way to trade one ERC-20 token for another.",
"For end-users, swapping is intuitive: a user picks an input token and an output token. They specify an input amount, and the protocol calculates how much of the output token they’ll receive. They then execute the swap with one click, receiving the output token in their wallet immediately.",
"Swaps in Xchange are different from trades on traditional centralized exchange platforms. Xchange does not use an order book to represent liquidity or determine prices. Xchange uses a constant product automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on rates and slippage.",
"To provide leverage to the system, the Lending Pool acts as the manager of both funds and loans. This contract will be interacted with by Xchange.",
"The Lending Pool is funded through two primary mechanism, by external deposits made by any wallet and through money owned by the system.",
"To fund the Lending Pool, ETH from the X7 token ecosystem has been accumulating in the Ecosystem Splitter and will be the first liquidity deposited into the Lending Pool. This ETH will be locked forever and will grow over time. Users are also able to contribute to the Lending Pool via Deposits. The code owns this money and it will never leave the system.",
"Users will be able to deposit ETH and receive an X7 deposit token. When X7Deposit is minted, it is a face value equivalent to ETH.\n\n1 X7D = 1 ETH\n\nWhen deposited, the ETH will enter the Lending Pool and be available for automated lending. The Lending Pool will maintain a reserve of constellation tokens sufficient to back any externally funded Lending Pool liquidity. X7D tokens can be wrapped in an NFT and staked. At maturity, this NFT will pay returns based on the rising constellation token floor.",
"Lending is a fully automatic process managed fully by Xchange’s interfacing with the Lending Pool via Initial Liquidity Loans.\n\nFor end-users, wanting to participate in lending: a user selects the amount of Ether to deposit or withdraw from the Lending Pool. Receipts for deposit are issued in X7 deposit, redeemable 1-to-1 with Eth, and may be staked for a portion of the loan fees.",
"An initial liquidity loan provides a mechanism to add initial liquidity to an automated market making trading pair with borrowed capital. The terms and conditions for borrowing this capital and returning it to the lender provide for the lender and the borrower to manage their cost of capital and repayment schedules in a way that supports the nature of the offering and the size and duration of the loan.",
"Loan terms are defined by standalone smart contracts that provide the following:\n\n\n1. Loan origination fee\n2. Loan retention premium fee schedule\n3. Principal repayment condition/maximum loan duration\n4. Liquidation conditions and Reward\n5. Loan duration",
"Much in the same way an IPO is underwritten by a bank as a market maker, the X7 borrowing capability provides this capacity within the context of the Uniswap V2 automated market maker technology.",
"Xchange’s intuitive UI will allow an easy selection of terms. Simply select the amount you wish to borrow and the Initial Liquidity Loan term you want to use, and the number of tokens you wish to include in the pair.",
"Liqudity Tokens are sent to the borrower’s specified address and remain in full control by the borrower. The borrower is free to lock the liquidity in any service they wish, transfer or hold them. Liquidity Tokens are not able to re be redeemed for the liquidity while a loan is active.",
"All dynamic aspects of the X7 ecosystem will ultimately rest with the DAO to decide upon.\n\nThe DAO will be responsible for modifying tokenomics, changing profit allocation, upgrading the upgradeable components, and determining the long-term fate of locked liquidity.\n\nThe X7DAO token is the voting token within the DAO, and a portion of project revenue will flow into the DAO token in the form of liquidity injections.\n\n The expected outcome is that DAO holders will maximize the medium and long-term gain of the DAO token. The ecosystem properly aligns this selfish profit motive with the efficient and healthy operation of the ecosystem.",
"The DAO shall operate through central governance contracts. For all functions the DAO may control, there will be two options:\n\n1. Make the relevant change\n2. Delegate the authority to make those kinds of changes to an address."]
